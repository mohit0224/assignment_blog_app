According to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Ms Kavitha had told Mr Reddy that in case he does not pay the amount to the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the national capital, his business will be harmed in Telangana and Delhi. Mr Reddy, who was an accused in a money-laundering case linked to the alleged liquor scam in Delhi, had turned an approver in the case that is being probed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).

		description:
			"Experts often highlight social media and harsh economic times as key reasons why young people are getting unhappier. And while those factors are important, I would like to emphasise another.Younger generations have less freedom and independence than previous generations did. The area where children are allowed to range unsupervised outside has shrunk by 90% since the 1970s. Parents increasingly organise entertainment – ranging from play dates and sports and music classes to family cinema trips – for their children, rather than letting them come up with it themselves. Perhaps this can help explain recent reports that many teenagers today choose to be holed up in their bedrooms. The lack of childhood freedom isn't just a result of parental control. Societal expectations and school policies also have huge influences.",

It was pretty straightforward previously – the S series was the flagship, the A series sat a step below, the M was mid-range, and the F was the budget offering. That hasn’t changed, but the lines are blurrier than ever. Design and display Sure, software support is no longer a clear differentiator between the different series. But Samsung still tries to distinguish them through materials and build quality. The A-series has glass backs and even metal frames, while the M55 is an all-plastic affair. Here’s the surprising bit though – the M55 feels much better in hand than those pricier A-series phones for a couple of reasons. First, it has curved sides and a slightly curved back that doesn’t dig into your palms like those two new A models. Secondly, at just 180g and 7.8mm thick, it’s remarkably light and slim. Combine that with trimmer bezels than the A35, and you have a device that looks more premium despite the cheaper materials.",

This wearable device promises to be a “second brain” and a new approach to personal computing, but does it live up to the hype?

For that cost, you get a wearable pin with a built-in microphone, camera, and projection capabilities, powered by Humane’s Cosmos operating system. The idea is that you can interact with the device hands-free by tapping and talking to it, much like the communicators in Star Trek. It can be attached to your clothing, specifically near your chest, freeing your hands for other tasks.   One of the Ai Pin’s standout features is its real-time translation capability, which several reviewers praised for its accuracy and natural-sounding voice. Julian Chokkattu from Wired described it as “solid” and was impressed by how quickly it could translate between languages without needing to specify which one the speaker was using.",

The tech giant is under mounting pressure in the United States and Europe over allegations that its apps were addictive and have fueled mental health issues among young people. Meta said the protection feature for Instagram’s direct messages would use on-device machine learning to analyse whether an image sent through the service contains nudity. “Because the images are analysed on the device itself, nudity protection will also work in end-to-end encrypted chats, where Meta won’t have access to these images – unless someone chooses to report them to us,” the company said.",

Leafy greens are usually low in calories but high in nutrient value, which may leave you feeling hungry or wanting more. Avocado has good fat which is mono unsaturated that will allow you to feel full for longer and also reduce your hunger cravings. It can also help better absorb the nutrients from leafy greens. Also, leafy greens that are high in iron content can cause constipation, avocado helps offset this side effect with its good fats that allows food and waste to move downward smoothly. Coffee with 1 tsp ghee, which is also called bulletproof coffee may seem like an odd combination but has many health benefits. Coffee mainly contains caffeine, tannin, carbohydrates, and proteins. In Ayruveda, coffee is considered hot and stimulating in nature. Coffee by nature has a drying effect on the digestive tract and colon, which can trigger constipation and digestive issues in the long run. Ghee (clarified butter) has healthy fats and butyric acid that lubricates the GI tract and offsets the dryness from coffee. Ghee is also a rich source of saturated fats, it contains 99.8% good fats. Ghee contains Vitamin A, E and K Yoghurt with 1 tsp honey: We usually consume yoghurt with sweeteners like sugar or condiments like salt and cumin powder.
